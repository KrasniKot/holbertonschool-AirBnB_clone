<h1> AirBnB clone: The console </h1>

<div align="left">

- This is the first step towards building our first full web application: the [AirBnB](https://es.airbnb.com/) clone.

## What’s a command interpreter?
- A user can interact with the operating system through a special process, in our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:
  * Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
  * Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
  * Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
  * Update attributes of an object
  * Destroy an object
